Platforms and checkpoints are positioned at specific coordinates in the game world.
- Collision Detection
Platforms: The player stands on platforms and cannot move through them.
Checkpoints: The player claims checkpoints by colliding with them. Once claimed, checkpoints become inactive.
- Screen Boundaries
The player cannot move beyond the left and right edges of the canvas.
The game world moves left or right as the player approaches the screen edges.
